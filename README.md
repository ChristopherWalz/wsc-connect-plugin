# WSC-Connect Plugin
Feel free to submit pull requests to improve the plugin.

Requirements
------------
This plugin requires [WoltLab Suite Core](https://github.com/WoltLab/WCF) in version 3.0.4 or later.

Your instance has to be accessible without security features like `.htaccess`/Basic Auth; this means you can't use this plugin within your testing environment if you're using commercial products by WoltLab within the same installation.

Take part
---------
You can [register your own WSC-Instance](https://www.wsc-connect.com/register) right after you installed the plugin into your WSC.
